## Game Description:-

We will make a space invaders game where aliens will come down from the top of the screen and try to reach the bottom. You can control the ship at the bottom and move it left or right as well as shoot a bullet to kill the aliens.  

If an alien reaches the bottom then the player will lose one life. The game can be customizable with the number of lives and difficulty level of the game.

The player will gain points for each alien he kills, when the player gains certain level of points he will face a big alien that he has to kill.


## Game Rules:-

1. You have to kill the alliens coming down  
2. The spaceship at the bottom has to shoot to kill the alliens and simultaneously dodge the aliens  
3. If the aliens pass the spaceship then the space ship will lose health (hp)  
4. If the alien touches the spaceship the game is over  
5. You need to click the save option to save the game after a certain stage you can not simply quit otherwise no data will be saved  

## Features:-

1. Data structures such as arrays will be used to track the aliens progress in reaching the ground and will also be used to track        their movement 

2. Interactive and customizable difficulty, health and points gained  

3. The speed of the aliens coming down will increase randomly so that will cover the first requirement i.e Generation of random game    sets or events  

4. Use File input/output to store the status of the game after every wave of aliens after which the user can quit the game or            continue. If the player chooses the quit then the game can be loaded at a later time  

5. Using makefile to compile different files with each file holding information about different entities or functions of the game
