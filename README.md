## Game Description:-

We have made a cricket game, the idea came from the hand cricket game which is a pretty common game in South Asia just like rock paper scissors. 

There are two people in the hand cricket game, first there is a toss at the start and the person who wins the toss decides if he wants to bat first or ball first. So the person batting has to show a finger of his hand to make runs. For example if the person shows 2 of his fingers he gets 2 runs, if he shows a thumbs up he will get 6 runs, when the person batting is showing his fingers at the same time the opponent who is bowling will also show his finger if he shows the same finger as the person who is batting the person who is batting is out and now it is the opponent's turn to bat. At the end of the game the person with more runs will win the match.



## Game Rules:-

1. First there will be a toss, you have to choose either heads or tails

2. If you win the toss, you have to choose whether you want to bat or bowl 

3. You have to choose which format you want to play (How many overs you want per innings. There are 6 balls per over)

4. Then you will have to decide how many players you would have on your team and on the opponents team  

5. You have to choose a number between 1 and 6 when it's your turn for batting

6. If your decision and your opponent's decision are the same, then the player who is batting is out

7. When all the players in the team are out then the first innings (the first part of the game) is over and the second innings will be started

8. Each player will get a chance to bat and bowl in the same match

9. The team that scores more during their batting is declared as the WINNER at the end of the match

10. If both teams score the same, then the result will be a draw

### Enjoy!!!



## Features:-

1. Data structures such as arrays will be used to track the aliens progress in reaching the ground and will also be used to track        their movement 

2. Interactive and customizable difficulty, health and points gained  

3. The speed of the aliens coming down will increase. We will also include random power up drops so that will cover the first requirement i.e Generation of random game    sets or events  

4. Use File input/output to store the status of the game after every wave of aliens after which the user can quit the game or            continue. If the player chooses the quit then the game can be loaded at a later time  

5. Using makefile to compile different files with each file holding information about different entities or functions of the game
